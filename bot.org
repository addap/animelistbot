/add Title -> Bot does fuzzy lookup of title on myanimelist and returns list of results. inline keyboard to switch between results and choose the correct one
/watch (alias, amt)+ -> increase the watched counter on the aliases by amt. If the watched counter is the maximum the anime gets moved to done
/drop alias+ -> move title to dropped
/set (alias, amt)+ -> secret. just sets the counter
